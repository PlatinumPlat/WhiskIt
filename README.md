## WhiskIt
Master the culinary arts one whisk at a time!

# Description
WhiskIt is a revolutionary AI-based tool which guides you step by step in your cooking/baking journey! Our "whisk" application accepts user input with the ingredients they have available in their fridge and generates a precise recipe with an ingredients list and detailed steps. Afterwards, users can copy and paste the steps they require visual guidance for into our "mix" tool, which generates an image for that step. Our "mix" image generation feature will be replaced with AI video generation in the future.
